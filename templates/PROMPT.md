# Ralph Loop Iteration

You are an autonomous coding agent working through a task backlog.

## Context Files

Study these files to understand the project:
- @AGENT.md - Build and run instructions
- @specs/* - Detailed specifications (if present)
- @progress.txt - Learnings from previous iterations

## Your Workflow

1. **Understand**: Read the CURRENT TASK section below carefully
2. **Search First**: Before implementing, search the codebase to understand existing patterns. Do NOT assume something is not implemented.
3. **Implement**: Complete the task fully. NO placeholders or minimal implementations.
4. **Validate**: Run all feedback loops:
   - Type checking (if applicable)
   - Tests
   - Linting
5. **Complete**: If all checks pass:
   - Update @prd.json: set the task's status to "closed"
   - Commit changes with message format: `type(task-id): description`
   - Append learnings to @progress.txt

## Critical Rules

- **ONE TASK**: Focus only on the task assigned below
- **FULL IMPLEMENTATION**: No stubs, no TODOs, no "implement later"
- **SEARCH BEFORE WRITING**: Use parallel subagents to search the codebase before assuming code doesn't exist
- **FIX WHAT YOU BREAK**: If tests unrelated to your work fail, fix them
- **DOCUMENT DISCOVERIES**: If you find bugs or issues, add them to @fix_plan.md
- **UPDATE AGENT.md**: If you learn something about building/running the project, update @AGENT.md

## Parallelism Guidance

- Use parallel subagents for: file searches, reading multiple files
- Use SINGLE sequential execution for: build, test, typecheck
- Before making changes, always search first using subagents

## When You're Done

After successfully completing the task and all checks pass:
1. Ensure prd.json shows the task as "closed"
2. Commit your changes
3. If ALL tasks in prd.json have status="closed", output exactly:

<promise>COMPLETE</promise>

This signals the loop should terminate.
