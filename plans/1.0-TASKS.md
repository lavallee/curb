does curb-init need to be its own executable or can it roll into curb as an init subcommand?

let’s have default hooks enabled, such that when starting an epic, a new branch is cut (unless it’s already on one), and when ending an epic, a pr is requested.

let’s add a version subcommand.

let’s give curbs a session name, which can default to a random animal or be set with —name (this way, different instances running concurrently can be distinguished)

when taking on work when beads is available, set the assignee to the session name.

Use the -a or --assignee flag with bd update:

  bd update <issue-id> -a <assignee>
  # or
  bd update <issue-id> --assignee <assignee>

  There's also --claim which atomically sets the assignee to you and status to in_progress:

  bd update <issue-id> --claim
