## Context
Need to understand Gemini CLI before implementing harness.

## Implementation Hints

**Recommended Model:** sonnet
**Estimated Duration:** 30m
**Approach:** Install Gemini CLI, test invocation patterns, document findings.

## Implementation Steps
1. Research Gemini CLI installation (likely gcloud or standalone)
2. Test basic invocation with prompt
3. Document flags for: auto mode, system prompt, streaming
4. Check for usage/token reporting
5. Note any significant differences from Claude/Codex

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Installation method documented
- [ ] Basic invocation working
- [ ] Flags mapped to curb needs
- [ ] Token reporting capability assessed
- [ ] Findings written to .chopshop/spikes/gemini.md

## Files Likely Involved
- .chopshop/spikes/gemini.md (new)
