## Context
Need to understand OpenCode CLI before implementing harness.

## Implementation Hints

**Recommended Model:** sonnet
**Estimated Duration:** 30m
**Approach:** Install OpenCode CLI, test invocation patterns, document findings.

## Implementation Steps
1. Research OpenCode CLI installation
2. Test basic invocation with prompt
3. Document flags for: auto mode, system prompt, streaming
4. Check for usage/token reporting
5. Note differences from other harnesses

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Installation method documented
- [ ] Basic invocation working
- [ ] Flags mapped to curb needs
- [ ] Token reporting capability assessed
- [ ] Findings written to .chopshop/spikes/opencode.md

## Files Likely Involved
- .chopshop/spikes/opencode.md (new)
