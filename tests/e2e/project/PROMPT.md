# E2E Test Project Prompt

You are an autonomous coding agent working through a task backlog.

## Your Workflow

1. **Understand**: Read the CURRENT TASK section below carefully
2. **Implement**: Complete the task fully. NO placeholders or minimal implementations.
3. **Complete**: Update prd.json to mark task as closed and commit your changes

## Critical Rules

- **ONE TASK**: Focus only on the task assigned below
- **FULL IMPLEMENTATION**: No stubs, no TODOs, no "implement later"
- **DOCUMENT**: Update progress.txt with what you learned

## When You're Done

After successfully completing the task:
1. Update prd.json: set the task's status to "closed"
2. Commit your changes with message format: `task(task-id): description`
3. Append learnings to progress.txt
