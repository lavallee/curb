## Task: curb-a4p - Document config schema (Completed 2026-01-10)

### What was done
Created comprehensive configuration reference documentation in `docs/CONFIG.md` covering:
- Configuration precedence and priority order (CLI flags > env vars > project config > global config > defaults)
- All configuration sections: Harness, Budget, Loop, Clean State, Hooks
- Complete environment variables reference (15+ variables documented)
- CLI flags reference (16+ flags documented)
- Directory structure (XDG-compliant paths)
- Configuration examples for common scenarios (development, production, CI/CD, per-model)
- Debugging and troubleshooting sections

### Key learnings
1. Configuration hierarchy is well-designed with clear precedence rules
2. All config options have sensible defaults that work for most use cases
3. The configuration system supports both global (~/.config/curb/config.json) and project-level (.curb.json) overrides
4. Budget tracking is particularly important for cost control - warn_at threshold helps prevent surprise costs
5. Hooks system is flexible but requires clear documentation on locations and structure

### Files created/modified
- Created: docs/CONFIG.md (523 lines, comprehensive reference)
- Modified: README.md (added link to CONFIG.md in Configuration section)
- Task status: closed via beads (curb-a4p)

### Test results
All 327 existing BATS tests pass after changes.

### Dependencies
- Task blocks: curb-61a (Checkpoint: Curb 1.0 Ready for Release)
- No blocking dependencies
